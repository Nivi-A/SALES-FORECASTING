# SALES-FORECASTING
This project focuses on time series forecasting for sales prediction using multiple models, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), CNN-LSTM hybrid, and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). The goal is to compare the performance of these models and identify the most effective approach for accurate sales forecasting. Various evaluation metrics, such as RMSE, MAE, MAPE, MSE, and R-squared score, are utilized to assess the accuracy of the models. The results provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each model, enabling businesses to make informed decisions regarding their sales forecasting strategies.
